# MyCalculator
A simple calculator.

This calculator was inspired and styled after the iOS calculator. In portrait mode, you can compute
basic calculations with +, -, /, and * as well as the numbers 0-9. In landscape mode, you can compute
more complex calculations such as logs, exponents, and factorials.
